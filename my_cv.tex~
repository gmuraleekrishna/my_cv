\section{Academic Projects}
\cventry{2014}{Autonomous Car}{Machine learning, Image processing, GPS, Embedded systems}{}{}{Prototype of a car that can reach the given destination on its own. Vehicle uses GPS module to identify for the checkpoints enroute and magnetometric compass module to measure the vehicle heading. An Onboard embedded processing board with ARMv7 is used for path resolution and ATmega328P to drive the motors.}
\cventry{2014}{Digital EDA and Emulation using RaspberryPi}{Embedded Sytems, EDA}{}{}{This project enables the computer generated digital circuits to be accessed to real world, and manipulate the inputs using voltages like HIGH(+3.3) and LOW(0V) and measure the ouput using standard display and measurement devices. This helps students to interactively build digital circuits. Python was the programming language used.}
\cventry{2013}{Multilayered display using water drops}{Image processing, Fluid mechanics, Embedded systems}{}{}{To prototype a 3D display system using water drops. The system uses a projector-camera system which synchronizes the flow of water drops and displays images on them. The blob detection techniques was used to detect and predict the position of droplets.}
\cventry{2013}{pingoLux - A multi-surface projection keyboard}{Image processing}{}{}{As the name suggests it is a touch-on-light keyboard. The laser projected image of a keyboard can be projected on any flat surface. The keyentry is done by pressing on the projected image, which is detected by a camera. The location of keypress is identified by blob detection on thresholded image}
\cventry{2013}{Digital Score Display Board}{Embedded System}{}{}{This digital scoreboard is used to help the score keepers to display the current team standing to the audience at ease. The system uses ATmega328P to process the data from serial interface and update the LED matrix. A series of SIPO buffers are used for port expansion. The highlight of the project is the flexibility and usability of the user interface provided. The code is completely opensource. The communication between the system and the client (laptop) is using XBee \textregistered 802.15.4 PRO.}
\cventry{2010}{Railway reservation system using C++}{System application}{}{}{The graphical application was a proof oc concept, which mimiced the  railway reservation and cancellation terminals available at train stations. The project concetrated on developing a network enabled graphical interface for ticketing. The primary goal of this higher secondary school project to deepen the knowledge of C++ programming language}
